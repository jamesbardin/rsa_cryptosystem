In this assignment, you will be implementing bignums, along with several operations on bignums, including addition and multiplication. We provide code that will use your
bignum implementation to implement the RSA cryptosystem. Once you complete your bignum implementation, you’ll be able to encrypt and decrypt messages using this public-key cryptosystem, and discover a hidden message that we’ve provided encoded in this way.
